# Test Koji

To be honest with you, it was my first time with TypeScript. I knew what it was made for but I never used it. <br/>
So it took me more than an hour to build this project :sweat_smile: 
Especially to read docs, and figure out how it works. <br/>
With plain JavaScript I would have been way more efficient, but that's how you grow up ! :muscle: <br/>
I've decided to do this exercise with Redux, I know that is not necessary for such a small application, but I like to use it for a better architecture, and a more efficient props and state management. <br/>
I realised that it was maybe not a good idea for a first time with TypeScript but I like challenges :sunglasses: <br/>
At the end, in order to try to do it as fast as possible, I didn't take time to customize it with css, I used really 
basic Bootstrap tools. <br/>
I also could have refactor the interfaces, to make it as DRY as possible, and use a better type hinting. <br/>
