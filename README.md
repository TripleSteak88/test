# Test Koji

To be honest with you, it was my first time with TypeScript. I knew what it was made for but I never used it.
So it took me more than an hour to build this project :sweat_smile:
Especially to read docs, and figure out how it works.
With plain JavaScript I would have been way more efficient, but that's how you grow up ! :muscle:
I've decided to do this exercise with Redux, for a better architecture, and a more efficient props and state management,
but maybe it was not a good idea for a first time with TypeScript :sweat_smile:
At the end, in order to try to do it as fast as possible, I didn't take time to customize it with css, I used really
basic Bootstrap tools.
I also could have refactor the interfaces, to make it as DRY as possible, and use a better type hinting.
